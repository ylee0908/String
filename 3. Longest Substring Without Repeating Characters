3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        d = dict()
        i = 0
        max_len = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] in d and i <= d[s[j]]:
                i = d[s[j]] + 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, j-i+1)
            d[s[j]] = j
        return max_len
